<p class="copy">Albert Pujols's MLB journey began when he was selected 402nd overall in the 1999 draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Almost 24 years later, Pujols's recent retirement marks the end of a 
    hall-of-fame <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pujolal01.shtml">career</a> that spanned over two decades. The Dominican slugger hung his cleats up after winning two World
    Series Championships with the Cardinals, three National League MVP awards and 11 All-Star selections. Pujols burst onto the scene in the early 2000s and quickly made his mark as one of the most
    feared hitters in all of baseball. Injuries, age and the shift had a significant effect on his career by the mid-2010s, but Pujols had a late resurrection, hitting his 700th homerun in his final
    season.

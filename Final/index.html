        Avenue in College Park on Oct. 13. Walking in a well-lit area didn&#39;t help the three women who reported the indecent exposure in Old Town.</p>

        <p class="copy">“Trust your instincts” and “walk in well-lit areas” are just two of the safety tips that are included in each report of criminal 
        activity from the University of Maryland Alerts System. The system is controlled by the school&#39;s police department and sends out a mass email whenever 
        it receives information it believes the whole campus should know. What was once a monthly update about severe thunderstorms with the occasional report 
        of “suspicious” activity has become a nearly weekly report of armed robberies and indecent exposures.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="copy">“It forces me to be fearful of my surroundings,” said Jamie Narciso, whose apartment overlooks the 8600 block of Baltimore Avenue where 
        the Oct. 13 robbery took place. “It&#39;s concerning and scary… you just never know what could happen.”</p>

        had the third most violent crimes of any county in the state in 2020. But students feel particularly anxious when that bubble pops.</p>

        <p class="copy">“Something&#39;s gotta be done to prevent that stuff,” said Daniel Cesare, who was in the Robert H. Smith School of Business the afternoon of Oct. 5 
        when police said an indecent exposure occurred in Rudy&#39;s Café. “It makes me very uncomfortable. I&#39;m there in that building at least three times a week.”</p>

        <p class="copy">Some hoped that winter break would mark a turning point and that when everyone returned, things would be different. Jan. 25 was the first day of 
        classes for the Spring semester and it only took two days for an armed robbery to happen on Baltimore Avenue.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="copy">Things cooled off in February, but March saw College Park return to Fall form with a voyeur incident and an unlawful touching occurring within 10 
        days of each other. An indecent exposer, armed carjacker and “armed person” infested campus during April.</p>

        <p class="copy">What&#39;s maybe the scariest thing about these reports is that they reflect a spike in campus crime from last school year to this one. From Aug. &#39;21 to Apr. &#39;22, 
        UMD Alerts issued 16 reports of criminal behavior on and around campus. There were 17 such reports in the first semester of this year, alone. That is, from Aug. to Dec. &#39;22, 
        there was a criminal incident roughly once a week on average. The aforementioned six in 2023 put this school year&#39;s total at 23 at the writing of this article.</p>

        <p class="copy">“I can&#39;t recall too many conversations with students kind of expressing their own perception of safety here outside of the standard college campus safety awareness,” said 
        Dr. Justine Madoo, a senior lecturer in the University&#39;s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice. “From last year, there&#39;s definitely a difference, but I don&#39;t know 
        if these students have connected that yet.”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="copy">The University offers 25 emergency response telephones, known as blue light phones, placed strategically around campus. However, these phones can be hard to use or even remember, 
        as they require callers to talk with a police officer, which may not be possible in the heat of the moment.</p>
